## Running this project locally

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed.
    > Make sure you install node version 8 or above and check node version by running `node -v`
1. Then clone this repo
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/coderplex/coderplex.git
    ```
1. `cd coderplex`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev` to start local development server
1. App opens at `localhost:3000`

**Note:**
> So our team's official policy (for now) is: We only use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) as our official Node package manager, and so we request you to use Yarn instead of npm and commit yarn.lock file.
